# Project

This is an old website I initally started in college using Dreamweaver...back in 2005/2006. I have since revisited this site many times in order to implement new technologies and techniques I have learned along the way. This is, in short, a testing playground to try and write more concise and effective code.

## Goals

To refactor as much as I can and still achieve the same amount of functionality as before, or more so. Since the last time I visited this project, I was able to refactor over 400 lines of jquery code to about 15. I plan on replacing jquery with vanilla javascript in the near future, as well as address some bugs with the layout.
